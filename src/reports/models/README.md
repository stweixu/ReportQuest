# Points and Report Class Documentation

This documentation provides an overview and usage details for the `Points` and `Report` classes. These classes are data models representing points accumulated by users and report details submitted by users in a fault reporting system. The `Points` class is a standard Python class, while `Report` is built using the Pydantic library.

## Overview

The `Points` class models a user's points information, including the points accumulated and the timestamp of the last update. The `Report` class models report data, such as report status, relevance, severity, urgency, and additional details about the report, using Pydantic for data validation.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Pydantic** (required for the `Report` class):

    ```bash
    pip install pydantic
    ```

2. Ensure `Points` and `Report` classes are imported into your project.

## Classes

### Points

The `Points` class is a simple data model that represents a user's points and the timestamp of the last points update.

#### Attributes

-   **user_id** (`str`): The unique identifier for the user.
-   **points** (`int`): The number of points the user has accumulated.
-   **last_updated** (`int`): The timestamp (in Unix format) of the last points update.

#### Methods

-   `__repr__`: Returns a string representation of the `Points` object for easy debugging and logging.

#### Usage

```python
points_record = Points(user_id="user123", points=100, last_updated=1638230400)
print(points_record)  # Output: Points(user_id=user123, points=100, last_updated=1638230400)
```

### Report

The `Report` class models the details of a user report in a structured format. This class uses Pydantic for type validation and default value handling.

#### Attributes

-   **user_id** (`str`): The unique identifier of the user who created the report.
-   **relevance** (`int`): A rating for the relevance of the report, typically between 1-10.
-   **severity** (`int`): A rating for the severity of the issue described in the report.
-   **urgency** (`int`): A rating for the urgency of the issue.
-   **status** (`str`, default: `"Pending"`): The current status of the report (e.g., "Pending," "In Progress," or "Resolved").
-   **report_id** (`str`): A unique identifier for the report.
-   **description** (`Optional[str]`): A description of the issue reported.
-   **image_path** (`Optional[str]`): The file path to an image associated with the report.
-   **title** (`Optional[str]`): A concise title for the report.
-   **datetime** (`int`): The timestamp (in Unix format) representing when the report was created.
-   **location** (`str`): The location of the reported issue.
-   **points** (`int`, default: `0`): Points associated with the report.
-   **ollama_description** (`str`, default: `""`): A description generated by the Ollama model, if applicable.
-   **authority_id** (`str`, default: `""`): An identifier for the authority associated with this report.

#### Usage

```python
from datetime import datetime
import uuid

report = Report(
    user_id="user123",
    relevance=8,
    severity=7,
    urgency=6,
    report_id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
    description="Street light is broken and posing a hazard.",
    datetime=int(datetime.now().timestamp()),
    location="123 Main St, Springfield",
)

print(report)
```

This `Report` object can be easily validated and manipulated within Pydantic-based frameworks, ensuring accurate type checking and defaults in complex applications.
