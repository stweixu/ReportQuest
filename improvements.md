### Codebase Improvements with Microservices

1. **Decouple Core Services**:

    - Separate services into well-defined, independently deployable units, such as `User Service`, `Report Service`, `Rewards Service`, and `Notification Service`.
    - This decoupling enables each service to be maintained, scaled, or even refactored independently, minimizing risk to the entire system during updates.

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**:

    - Introduce an event bus or message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to facilitate asynchronous communication between services.
    - This would improve responsiveness, particularly for handling user actions like reward claims or report submissions that require multiple services to collaborate.

3. **Centralized API Gateway**:

    - Implement an API Gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservices, centralize security features, and handle concerns like rate limiting and authentication.
    - This could simplify client interactions by presenting a unified API layer, while hiding the complexity of individual services.

4. **Enhanced Database Management**:

    - Each microservice could use its own database schema, enabling optimized data storage per service and avoiding complex joins that span unrelated data.
    - Implement a centralized logging service to track database interactions for better debugging and audit trails.

5. **Improved Fault Tolerance**:
    - Implement retries, fallbacks, and circuit breakers (e.g., using Resilience4J or Hystrix) for each service.
    - Use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and alerts.

### Future Features for Enhanced Functionality

1. **Advanced AI Features**:

    - **Intelligent Report Routing**: Use AI to analyze and categorize user reports, then route them to the most relevant authority or service.
    - **Predictive User Engagement**: Introduce a model that predicts when users are likely to engage with rewards or notifications, optimizing interaction.

2. **Enhanced Rewards System**:

    - **Dynamic Point Requirements**: Introduce dynamic reward costs based on user activity or seasonal events.
    - **Customizable Reward Generation**: Allow businesses or users to create custom reward types with specific parameters.

3. **Integration with External Services**:

    - Add OAuth support for social media platforms to let users authenticate via Google, Facebook, or Twitter.
    - Enable webhook-based notifications, allowing the system to integrate with third-party services or external APIs when specific events occur.

4. **Reporting and Analytics Dashboard**:
    - Provide a dashboard for authorities and admins to view reports, analyze trends, and track user activity.
    - Introduce analytics on user activity, popular rewards, and response times, using tools like Grafana or custom-built solutions.

By moving to microservices and integrating these features, the system would be well-positioned for scalable, AI-driven functionality and easier long-term maintenance.

### Push Notification Service Design

1. **Create a Dedicated Notification Service**:

    - Establish a separate `Notification Service` that handles all push notifications. This service would interact with other core services like `Report Service`, `Reward Service`, and `User Service`.
    - Use a message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to queue notifications. This setup allows the notification service to operate asynchronously, receiving events from other services without slowing them down.

2. **Types of Notifications**:

    - **Real-time Alerts**: Notify users immediately for time-sensitive events, such as report status updates, nearby incidents, or urgent rewards.
    - **Reward Milestones**: Alert users when they earn points or qualify for specific rewards.
    - **Periodic Summaries**: Send weekly or monthly summaries for non-urgent information, such as accumulated points or new available rewards.

3. **Configurable Notification Channels**:

    - **Mobile Push Notifications**: Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) to deliver push notifications to iOS and Android devices.
    - **Email and SMS Integration**: For users who prefer email or SMS, integrate services like SendGrid or Twilio to send notifications through these channels.
    - **In-App Notifications**: Build a notification center within the app where users can view recent alerts, enhancing engagement even for those who disable push notifications on their devices.

4. **Event-Driven Notifications**:

    - **Event Triggers**: Define specific events in other services (like report submission, reward claim, or new rewards available) that trigger notifications. The respective service would publish an event to the message broker, and the Notification Service would consume it to send out alerts.
    - **User Preference Management**: Store user preferences for notification types and channels in the `User Service`. The Notification Service can reference these preferences to determine the best way to alert each user.

5. **Monitoring and Analytics**:

    - Implement tracking to measure notification delivery success, open rates, and user engagement. Use tools like Prometheus for monitoring and visualization platforms like Grafana or DataDog to track the performance and effectiveness of notifications.
    - Track user interactions with notifications to inform AI-driven personalization (e.g., sending reminders based on past engagement patterns).

6. **Scalability and Fault Tolerance**:
    - **Retry Mechanism**: Build in retry logic for failed notifications, particularly for mobile and email channels where delivery can be unreliable.
    - **Load Balancing**: Distribute the load for notification delivery across multiple instances of the Notification Service to ensure reliability during peak times.

### Future Enhancements for Push Notifications

1. **AI-Driven Personalization**:

    - Use machine learning models to determine the best time to send notifications, based on individual user behavior.
    - Tailor content based on user engagement data, sending targeted messages that are more likely to capture interest.

2. **Geo-Fenced Notifications**:

    - For location-based reports or services, introduce geo-fenced notifications. For instance, notify users when a report is submitted nearby or if there is an emergency within a defined radius.

3. **Notification Scheduling**:

    - Allow users to schedule non-urgent notifications, such as summaries or updates on long-term reports, to receive them at times convenient for them.

4. **Admin Dashboard for Notification Management**:
    - Develop a dashboard for admins to manage, schedule, and customize notifications, along with analytics on performance. This would provide flexibility and insight into the effectiveness of the notifications.

Integrating push notifications with microservices and these enhancements would create a robust, responsive, and highly engaging system for users.
